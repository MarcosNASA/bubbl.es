            <p>
              According to the
              <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >ECMAScript Language Specification</a
              >, a block statement is composed by a pair of brackets and a list of statements. If you are familiar with
              functions or any sort of flow control statement (for loops, if statements, switch statements...), you are
              already familiar with blocks.

              <h3>What's the scope?</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              The scope can be seen as the set of rules which determines whether a variable is available or not in a
              specific execution context or region of the code.
            </p>
            <p>JS Scope is <var>lexically</var> determined.</p>
            <p>
              This means that the scopes are set before the code execution, during the compilation (<var>lexical</var>
              comes from the compilation <var>lexing</var> step where the code is split into tokens, the smallest
              meaningful chunks of information).
            </p>
            <p>
              We can take advantage of this information in order to predict and visualize the scopes just from looking
              at our code!
            </p>

              <h3>How do we visualize the scope chain?</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              The JS engine declares a scope for each block in the code and <var>assigns</var> each variable to the
              scope where it was declared.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to predict scopes, thus, we will have to think like the JS engine does! Every time we find a
              block in our code, we will assign a color to it. Every time we find a variable, we will also assign a
              color to it. But in order to do that, we need to dive into some concepts!
            </p>
            <section>

                <h4>Variables: target and source references</h4>
              </header>
              <p>Every variable in our program has one out of two roles: target or source.</p>
              <p>
                In technical documents, target is commonly referred as LHS (left-hand side) and source is commonly
                referred as RHS (right-hand side). This terminology was adapted by computer scientists from maths.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whenever we assign something to a variable, we say the variable is in a target reference position (or
                LHS): the variable is the target of the assignment operator.
              </p>
              <p>
                In other words, a source reference to a variable has a <var>writing</var> role: we write a value into
                the variable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whenever we pass a variable as an argument in a function call, we say the variable is in a source
                reference position (or RHS): our variable is the source of the value for the function parameter.
              </p>
              <p>
                In other words, a target reference to a variable has a <var>reading</var> role: we read the value that
                the variable holds.
              </p>
              <div tabindex="0">
                <pre>
var array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; // "array" is a target reference
    addOdds(...array); // "array" is a source reference</pre
                >
              </div>
              <p>To state it (clearly):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>a target reference is the one where we access a memory address to write a value in it, and</li>
                <li>a source reference is the one where we access a memory address to read a value from it.</li>
              </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
              <header>
                <h4>Variable declarations</h4>
              </header>
              <p>A variable declaration is a statement that allocates some space in memory to store a value.</p>
              <p>
                Formal variable declarations can be easily spotted: in JS, there are 3 keywords which will help us to
                formally declare a variable: <var>var</var>, <var>const</var> and <var>let</var>.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, there are other variables in the target roles that might join our variable declaration group,
                as in function parameters or loop declarations.
              </p>
              <div tabindex="0">
                <pre>
function add(a, b) {
    /* 
      a and b fulfill the target role and are indeed variable declarations
      which will be initialized with the passed arguments at run-time
    */
      return a + b;
    }</pre
                >
              </div>
            </section>
            <section>
              <header>
                <h4>Scope &amp; Variables</h4>
              </header>
              <p>
                The variables declared in a particular scope will only be available inside that scope and the nested
                ones.
              </p>
              <p>
                To understand JS scoping rules applied to variables availability, we need to differentiate between
                function scoped variables and block scoped variables.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before ES2015, the only way to declare a variable in JS was via the <var>var</var>variable declaration.
                The <var>var</var> variable declaration declares a <var>function scoped variable</var>. Function scoped
                variables set the bounds for their availability to the nearest enclosing function and, as we discussed
                previously, the nested blocks.
              </p>
              <p>
                ES2015 introduced <var>let</var> and <var>const</var> variable declarations. Both <var>let</var> and
                <var>const</var> variable declarations declare <var>block scoped variables</var>. Block scoped variables
                set the bounds for their availability to the nearest enclosing block (whether it is a function, a pair
                of brackets, an if statement, a for statement...), and, as we discussed previously, the nested blocks.

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
              </header>
              <p>
                The information we need to extract from the previous sub-Sections and which will give us the rules to
                assign a color to our variables can be summarized in two main ideas:<br />â€” Variable declarations will
                always have the color of the block where they are being declared, attending to the differences that
                using block or function scoped variables might carry. We will always consider function parameters as
                declarations inside the function scope.<br />â€” Whenever we find a variable in a source position or a
                variable in a target position which is not a variable declaration, we will perform a lookup for its
                declaration, starting in the current block all the way up to the outermost. We will stop as soon as we
                find it and will assign to it the color of the block where it was declared.
              </p>
              <p>
                With our current knowledge, we should be ready to test our new gained scope analysis skills!<br />Try
                revisiting our <var>addOdds</var> function and assign a colored bubble to each scope and variable we can
                find!

            <p>
              Bubbl.es is the first of the Â«3 pilars projectÂ» inspired by Kyle Simpson. It represents the scope chain as
              colored bubbles. The main purpose of this project is helping new JS students to understand the scoping
              system and is intended for small snippets; however, it should be able to handle any script.
